- 12:05 PM PST: The on-call engineer started investigating the issue by checking the status of our application servers and load balancer.
- 12:15 PM PST: The engineer noticed a misconfiguration in the load balancer, which was causing traffic to be routed away from the primary application server.
- 12:30 PM PST: The engineer escalated the issue to the infrastructure team, who started working on a fix.

- 02:30 PM PST: The primary application server was brought back online, and the web application was restored for all users.

**Root Cause and Resolution**

- The root cause of the outage was a misconfiguration in our load balancer, which caused the primary application server to be taken offline. The misconfiguration was caused by a recent update to our load balancer software, which introduced a new feature that was not properly configured.
- To resolve the issue, the infrastructure team had to manually update the load balancer configuration to route traffic back to the primary application server. This involved updating the load balancer software to the latest version and reconfiguring the load balancer to use the new feature correctly.

**Corrective and Preventative Measures**

- Improve our load balancer configuration management process to prevent misconfigurations.
- Implement automated testing of load balancer configurations to catch issues before they impact users.
- Provide better training and documentation for our infrastructure team on new features in load balancer software.
- Implement a rollback procedure for load balancer software updates to quickly recover from issues.
- Add monitoring and alerting for load balancer configurations to detect issues earlier.

**Conclusion**

The outage at XYZ Corporation was caused by a misconfiguration in our load balancer, which resulted in our primary application server being taken offline. The issue was detected by our monitoring system and escalated to the infrastructure team, who worked quickly to identify and resolve the issue. To prevent similar issues in the future, we will improve our load balancer configuration management process, implement automated testing, provide better training and documentation, and add monitoring and alerting.
