 ## User Accessing the Website:

A user wants to access the website hosted at www.foobar.com. They type the URL into their web browser and hit enter.
 ## Domain Name and DNS:

The domain name, foobar.com, serves as the human-readable address for the website. The "www" prefix is a subdomain commonly used to denote the World Wide Web. The DNS (Domain Name System) translates this domain name into an IP address. The www DNS record for foobar.com is configured to point to the server's IP address, 8.8.8.8.
 ## Server:

A server is a physical or virtual machine that hosts resources and services accessible over a network. In this infrastructure, we have one server that houses all the necessary components.
 ## Web Server (Nginx):

Nginx is a high-performance web server that handles HTTP requests from clients (like web browsers) and serves static content. It acts as the entry point for incoming web traffic, directing requests to the appropriate components.
 ## Application Server:

The application server hosts the dynamic content of the website. It executes the application logic, processes requests from the web server, and generates dynamic responses. In our case, it could be running a framework like Django, Flask, or Ruby on Rails, depending on the application's requirements.
 ## Application Files (Code Base):

The application files contain the codebase responsible for generating dynamic content and handling user requests. These files reside on the application server and are executed when requested by the web server.
 ## Database (MySQL):

MySQL is a relational database management system (RDBMS) used for storing and managing the website's data. It stores information such as user accounts, posts, comments, etc. The application server communicates with the database to retrieve and manipulate data as needed.
 ## Communication with User's Computer:

When a user requests the website, their computer sends an HTTP request to the server's IP address (8.8.8.8). This request is routed through the internet to the server. The server processes the request, generates a response (which may include dynamic content fetched from the application server or data retrieved from the database), and sends it back to the user's computer via HTTP.
